Blind Psychic Assassin
======================

Compiling and Installation
--------------------------
If you cloned the raw git repository, you need Autotools (autoconf, automake,
pkg-config), and must first run
  autoreconf -i

To compile, you need SDL and OpenGL, as well as a compiler and pkg-config. On
Debian/Ubuntu you can get these packages with
----------------
  sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libsdl1.2-dev build-essential pkg-config
----------------

Once everything is installed, run
----------------
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
----------------

You can run the program simply as
----------------
  blind-psychic-assassin
----------------

Gameplay
--------
In Blind Psychic Assassin, you play the part of a blind assassin who is forced
to see from other people's perspectives. You must therefore lift this curse by
assassinating the person whose sight you share, until none remain. You lose if
you kill a yet-innocent non-target.

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move and rotate your character (the red one with
the gun) and space or backspace to shoot. You have no control over your
perspective; wait until your target can see you. Press escape to quit.

The alternate WASD controls can be changed by specifying a four-letter string
as a command-line argument, eg "vuia" for the Neo2 keyboard layout.
